# COMPSCI250D Projects
This repository includes all the code I developed for Duke Universityâ€™s COMPSCI 250D course in Spring 2024. Projects span C and MIPS assembly code for problem-solving, circuit design in Logisim to build a CPU, and Java simulations to model cache behavior, showcasing work in computer architecture and low-level programming.
